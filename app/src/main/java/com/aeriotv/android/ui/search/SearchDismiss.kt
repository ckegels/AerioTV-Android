/**
 * Process-wide "close every open search field" signal.
 *
 * A search field left open on a tab used to re-summon the keyboard when the
 * user fullscreened media and then minimized to the mini player or PiP: the
 * MAIN route is disposed while the player route is on top, so popping back
 * re-mounted the tab with its saved `searchActive = true` and the field's
 * auto-focus effect ran again from scratch.
 *
 * Entering a fullscreen player raises [serial]; every search surface hosts
 * [CloseSearchOnLeave], which clears focus, hides the IME and closes its own
 * search state when the serial moves (or when its tab stops being active).
 *
 * A plain module-level signal rather than an injected singleton: this is
 * transient UI state with exactly one writer path, the same idiom as
 * DisplayModeSwitchSignal and PhoneMiniChrome.

 * handled here, so the keyboard cannot be re-summoned by the minimize or PiP
 * transition that follows.
 *
 * Safe to host unconditionally: it does nothing while [searchActive] is false.
