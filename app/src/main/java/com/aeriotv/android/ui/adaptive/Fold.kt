// Fold.kt
//
// Settings redesign phase 2: fold awareness, driven entirely by the OS-reported
// FoldingFeature rather than by device names or screen sizes.
//
// A two-pane layout on a foldable must not put a pane boundary anywhere except
// ON the crease. Splitting the window at a fixed 280dp on an unfolded Pixel
// Fold puts the divider a couple of centimeters to the left of the hinge, so
// the detail pane is the one that gets folded in half. Reading the hinge out of
// WindowLayoutInfo lets the sidebar end exactly where the crease begins.
//
// Both hinge orientations are handled, and they mean different things:
//
//  - VERTICAL: the crease runs top to bottom and splits the window LEFT and
//    RIGHT (book posture, and the same device lying flat). The side-by-side
//    Settings layout simply moves its boundary onto the hinge.
//
//  - HORIZONTAL, HALF_OPENED: tabletop. The crease runs left to right and the
//    window is physically bent across the middle, so a side-by-side boundary
//    would run a fold through BOTH panes. Settings stacks instead: sidebar in
//    the top segment, detail in the bottom one.
//
//  - HORIZONTAL, FLAT: the device is open flat and held in landscape. There is
//    no bend to work around, so the ordinary vertical split is kept and the
//    feature only matters if its hinge physically occludes pixels.
//
// [FoldInfo] is recomputed from every WindowLayoutInfo emission, so posture,
// orientation and bounds changes all reach the layout at runtime.
