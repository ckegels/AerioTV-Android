/**
 * Dispatcharr 503 parsing for the live tune path.
 *
 * Every 503 the Dispatcharr TS proxy returns carries a JSON body
 * `{"error": "<reason>"}` (see its proxy views.py). The reasons fall into two
 * operationally different buckets:
 *
 *  - "Channel is stopping, retry shortly" plus a `Retry-After: 1` header. The
 *    server is tearing down the PREVIOUS session for this channel (for example
 *    right after a cast ended). The same URL works again in about a second, so
 *    the only correct move is to wait the advertised interval and retry the
 *    SAME url.
 *  - "No available streams for this channel", "Channel resources unavailable",
 *    or a specific upstream error_reason (often with a `"waited": "Ns"` field).
 *    The server already tried the channel's streams and could not obtain one,
 *    so waiting on this URL is pointless and the client should walk to the next
 *    member stream itself.
 *
 * We deliberately NEVER infer a cause beyond what the server wrote. The older
 * Apple/Android copy guessed "too many connections", which was wrong for the
 * Nothing Phone ESPN HD session (session4.txt 01:48:51): the body said
 * something else entirely. Whatever text the server sends is what the user is
 * shown, verbatim.
