/**
 * Wraps the live raw-TS [Extractor] and rebases sample timestamps so the
 * player always sees ONE continuous timeline, even when Dispatcharr swaps the
 * channel's SOURCE stream underneath us (change_stream / server failover).
 *
 * Why this exists: on a switch we deliberately KEEP the HTTP connection
 * (AerioExoPlayerHolder.followStreamSwitch + SwitchSkipMediaSource) because a
 * second GET mints a new Dispatcharr client (stream_limit, 503 "stopping").
 * The backup provider's PTS, however, has nothing to do with the old one: it
 * can be +31 min, or reset to 0 (about -50 s). TsExtractor in MODE_SINGLE_PMT
 * only unwraps the 33-bit roll, so the new samples reached the renderers on a
 * foreign timeline: queued video was held as "too early" for up to 45 s
 * (render = 0.0 fps while the position advanced) or the whole timeline jumped,
 * with "Audio sink error: Unexpected audio track timestamp discontinuity".
 *
 * A hard re-tune is rejected (new GET, see above) and resetting the renderers
 * in place was tried 2026-09-15 and painted green/purple
 * (SwitchSkipMediaSource.kt:38-40). So the fix is arithmetic: keep the bytes
 * flowing and subtract a running offset from every sample time.
 *
 * Notes on the numbers:
 *  - Thresholds are Apple's, from TSHLSRemuxer.swift (switchPTSJumpForward
 *    5 s, switchPTSJumpBackward 2 s, sourceChangeReason): more than +5 s
 *    forward or more than -2 s backward relative to the same track's previous
 *    raw time is a new source, not B-frame reordering (a few frames) or
 *    ordinary upstream jitter.
 *  - The 33-bit PTS wrap NEVER reaches this class. TsExtractor runs every
 *    sample through TimestampAdjuster before TrackOutput.sampleMetadata, and
 *    the adjuster already unwraps the roll, so the times we see keep climbing
 *    across it and no jump is detected. (ContinuousTsExtractorTest proves a
 *    wrap-sized continuous sequence is passed through untouched.)
 *  - ONE offset is shared by all tracks, so audio and video stay locked to
 *    each other. The offset is latched by whichever track notices the jump
 *    FIRST, from that track's own continuity (nothing is ever emitted
 *    un-rebased, which is what would happen if we waited for video while
 *    audio was already crossing). Tracks that have not crossed yet keep using
 *    the PREVIOUS offset, so an old-timeline video sample trailing a
 *    new-timeline audio sample is still rebased correctly. When a later track
 *    crosses, its own candidate offset is compared with the latched one and
 *    accepted when it agrees within [CROSS_TRACK_TOLERANCE_US] (it does: both
 *    come from the same new source). Only a disagreement beyond that
 *    tolerance re-latches, and then only from VIDEO, which is the track the
 *    user actually sees.
 *  - Output is never allowed to go backwards across a rebase (clamped to
 *    last + 1 us). Away from a rebase the offset is a constant subtraction,
 *    so natural B-frame PTS reordering is preserved untouched.
