// PlaybackHeaders.kt
//
// ONE place that answers "what headers do this playlist's STREAM requests
// carry?" (Logan 2026-09-18).
//
// Before this, the same eight-line recipe -- read the active playlist, check
// the source type is Dispatcharr, take a non-blank apiKey, emit the legacy
// dual `X-API-Key` + `Authorization: ApiKey` pair -- was retyped at every
// playback entry point: each live tune in Navigation.kt, the cast tune, the
// VOD movie and episode routes, catch-up, DVR/recording playback, the
// multiview tiles, the Android Auto browse tree. Adding a header (which is
// exactly what the per-playlist User-Agent needed) meant finding all of them,
// and the per-playlist User-Agent had reached the Dispatcharr REST client only
// -- so Dispatcharr's Stats panel attributed a box's API traffic to it and its
// streams to nobody.
//
// The auth shape here is DELIBERATELY the legacy dual pair, matching what every
// one of those call sites already sent, not [PlaylistEntity.dispatcharrAuthMode]
// (which DispatcharrClient negotiates for REST calls). Nothing about the
// existing headers changes; the only addition is the custom User-Agent.
//
// Apple does the same thing through `ServerConnection.effectiveUserAgent`, which
// PlayerSession bakes into the locked playback header set for AVPlayer, the
// remux loopback proxy, mpv, catch-up and cast alike.
