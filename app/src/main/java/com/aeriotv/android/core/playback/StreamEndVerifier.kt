 * Verification for a live stream that ended cleanly (Dispatcharr's
 * "terminate on limit exceeded": the server ends the OLDEST client's stream
 * when a new client takes the user's last slot, and the booted client only
 * sees a clean end of stream).
 *
 * Reconnecting on a clean end is always right: the stream may simply have
 * been restarted. What must never happen is giving up on a guess, so the
 * player keeps reconnecting on an escalating backoff ([backoffMs]) and only
 * STOPS when this verifier can prove the account is out of slots:
 *
 *  - GET /api/accounts/users/me/ gives the account's `stream_limit` (0 = no
 *    limit, so a limit boot is impossible and nothing is ever verified), and
 *  - GET /proxy/ts/status (Dispatcharr admin Stats, apps/proxy/live_proxy)
 *    lists every live channel with its clients, each carrying `user_id` and
 *    `connected_at`, so we can count this account's sessions and see whether
 *    a NEWER one on another client exists.
 *
 * /proxy/ts/status is IsAdmin server-side, so a standard sub-account gets
 * 401/403: unverifiable, backoff only. Same for any transport failure or a
 * server too old to answer. [hook] is installed once by Navigation (the
 * Dispatcharr calls live in PlaylistRepository / DispatcharrClient); when it
 * is absent every caller falls back to backoff alone.
