/**
 * The whole playlist's guide, built ONCE from cached rows: one [GuideIndex]
 * per canonical channel id. Exposed as an immutable `Map<String, List>` so
 * every existing consumer that does `epgByChannel[channel.guideMatchKey]`
 * keeps working unchanged (phase 2 of the rebuild: new data layer behind the
 * old surface). The new grid renderer reads [index] directly.
 *
 * Replaces the four incremental map-surgery paths in the ViewModel (cached
 * paint, fresh fetch, layering landed, history merge) with a single
 * deterministic build: rows -> attach -> dedup -> index -> placeholders.
 * Anything that changes the cache writes to Room and rebuilds this.
